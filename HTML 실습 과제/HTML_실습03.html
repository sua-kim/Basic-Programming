        <p>I am attending <font color="#0A330E"><b>Ewha Womans University</b></font>.</p>
        <p>Ewha Womans University was established in 1886 as the first modern women's education institution in Korea. </p>
        <p>Based on the spirit of challenge and innovation, it has grown into the world's largest women's university by continuing to develop and leap forward.</p>
        <br>

        <h2 id="department">Department</h2>
        <p>My major is <b>Mechanical and Bioengineering</b> and my double major is <b>Software</b></p>
        <p>Mechanical and Bioengineering is a faculty to cultivate the best female engineers in the new bio-health industry through convergence research in the fields of mechanical engineering, biomedical engineering, and biodata.</p>
        <p>I am taking the bio data track to learn artificial intelligence, big data, etc.</p>
        <p>The strength of our department is that you can learn various fields and actively communicate with professors.</p>
        <p>However, it has not been long since the undergraduate school was established, so we have to develop our own path without the help of seniors.</p>

        <h2 id="hobby">Hobby</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Yoga</li>
                <p>I started with the purpose of correcting my posture. I have the flexibility close to a piece of wood, but I try to be consistent every day.</p>
            <li>riding a bike</li>
                <p>When the weather is nice, I go out for a bike ride. I love the day and night of the Han River!</p>

        <h2 id="dream">I want to be a developer &#128187</h2>
        <p>My dream is to become <b>an ever-growing developer</b>.</p> 
        <p>I think it's wonderful to be able to realize ideas through coding. I am studying hard and participating in web development clubs and internships to make my dreams come true.</p>
